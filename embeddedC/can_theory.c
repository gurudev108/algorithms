Controller Area Network (CAN) communication, a "Remote Frame" is a special type of CAN frame used to request data transmission from another CAN node.

1. Purpose: The primary purpose of a Remote Frame is to request specific data from a remote CAN node without transmitting the actual data. It acts as a data retrieval mechanism.

2. Structure: A Remote Frame has the following key components:
 - Identifier (ID): Like standard CAN frames, Remote Frames have a unique identifier that specifies the message's content and priority.
 - RTR Bit: The Remote Transmission Request (RTR) bit is set to indicate that this is a Remote Frame. It's the distinguishing feature that differentiates a Remote Frame from a Data Frame.
 - Data Length Code (DLC): The DLC field specifies the number of data bytes that are expected in response to the request. It defines the size of the expected data payload.

3. Usage:
 - When a CAN node receives a Remote Frame with an RTR bit set, it identifies this as a data request.
 - The receiving node with the matching ID and available data to fulfill the request prepares a Data Frame with the requested data.
 - The Data Frame is then transmitted back to the requesting node as a response to the Remote Frame.
 - The response Data Frame will have the same identifier (ID) as the original request.

4. Example:
 - Let's say you have two CAN nodes in a vehicle network, and Node A wants to retrieve the current vehicle speed from Node B.
 - Node A sends a Remote Frame with the specific ID and an RTR bit set, indicating it wants the speed data.
 - Node B, upon receiving the Remote Frame and recognizing the request, prepares a Data Frame with the speed data.
 - Node B sends the Data Frame as a response to Node A.
 - Node A receives the Data Frame and extracts the speed data.
