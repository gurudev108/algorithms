WON"T COMPILE - SAMPLE ONLY
Implementing a flash memory read/write driver in C typically involves low-level interaction with the hardware, such as managing communication protocols (SPI, I2C, etc.) and handling memory-mapped I/O registers. For simplicity, I'll provide a basic template that demonstrates how to structure a flash memory driver in C. This template assumes that you are interacting with a flash memory device over an SPI interface, which is common in embedded systems.

Here’s an example C code template for a simple flash memory read/write driver:

### C Code: Flash Memory Driver (SPI-based)

### Key Points in the Code:
1. **SPI Communication**: 
   - This example assumes that SPI communication is abstracted through the functions `spi_init()` and `spi_transfer()`. These would be provided by your platform or hardware-specific SPI driver.
   - `spi_transfer()` sends a byte to the flash memory and receives a byte back.

2. **Flash Commands**:
   - Flash memory chips typically have a set of commands for performing operations like reading, writing, and erasing. These commands are usually specified in the flash memory's datasheet.
   - In this example, commands like `FLASH_CMD_WRITE_PAGE`, `FLASH_CMD_READ_DATA`, and `FLASH_CMD_ERASE_SECTOR` are defined as per a common flash memory chip (you should refer to your chip’s specific datasheet).

3. **Write Operation**:
   - Writing to flash memory usually requires enabling write operations first using the `flash_write_enable()` function. 
   - The `flash_write_page()` function writes a page of data at a specified address.

4. **Read Operation**:
   - The `flash_read_data()` function reads data from a specified address.

5. **Erase Operation**:
   - Flash memory often requires erasing sectors before writing. The `flash_erase_sector()` function erases a sector of the flash memory.

6. **Busy-Wait**:
   - The `flash_wait_until_ready()` function uses the status register to busy-wait until the flash memory is ready for the next operation.

### Flash Memory Operations Overview:
- **Page Write**: Flash memory usually operates in pages (e.g., 256 bytes). You cannot write single bytes directly. First, the entire page must be erased, and then it can be rewritten.
- **Sector Erase**: Before writing data to a memory location, flash memory requires an erase operation (usually a sector, e.g., 4KB).
- **Status Register**: Most flash memory devices provide a status register to indicate whether the memory is busy performing a write or erase operation.

### Next Steps:
To use this driver, you would need to integrate the SPI communication functions specific to your platform and adjust the flash memory commands according to your hardware’s datasheet. This code can be extended to handle more complex scenarios such as error handling and partial page writes.
