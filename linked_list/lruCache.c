/*
Implement a LRU cache
The goal of this design exercise is to implement Least Recently Used (LRU), a common caching strategy, using a doubly linked list and hashing.

Problem statement: Least Recently Used (LRU) defines the policy to evict elements from the cache to make room for new elements when the cache is full, meaning it discards the least recently used items first.
