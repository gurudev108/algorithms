/* Implement an I2C driver

Writing an I2C driver requires a good understanding of the I2C protocol. I'll provide a high-level pseudocode representation of the I2C protocol 
and a simple I2C driver to send the string "hello world!".

First, a brief about the I2C protocol:

1. Start Condition: SDA (data line) goes low while SCL (clock line) is high.
Data/Address Bit Transmission: Send 8 bits (1 byte) of data or address. The data change must occur when the clock is low, and the data is sampled when the clock goes high.
Acknowledge Bit: After sending 8 bits, the master releases the SDA line and generates a single clock pulse on the SCL line. The slave device will pull the SDA line low during this pulse to acknowledge receipt of the byte.
Stop Condition: SDA line goes high while the SCL line is high.
Now, let's create a basic I2C driver to send "hello world!".


Question - How would you handle when I2C bus is busy
Handling a busy I2C bus is essential for preventing data corruption and ensuring smooth communication between the master and slave devices. The I2C bus can be busy in various scenarios, like:

1. Another master device is currently communicating on the bus.
2. A previously initiated communication was interrupted and the bus was left in an inconsistent state.
3. Noise or other interferences caused misreading of signals.

To handle a busy I2C bus, consider the following strategies:

1. **Bus Arbitration**:
   - In multi-master setups, bus arbitration ensures that if two masters start transmission simultaneously, only one continues. Masters check if the bus level matches their output and, if not, they will know another master is controlling the bus. In such cases, the master can wait and retry after a random backoff time or a fixed delay.
   
2. **Timeout Mechanism**:
   - Implement a timeout mechanism. When trying to acquire the bus, if it remains busy for longer than a certain duration, you can assume there's an issue and initiate corrective action.
   
3. **Bus Clearing (Clock Stretching)**:
   - Sometimes, a slave device may pull the SCL line low (a mechanism called clock stretching) to tell the master it's not ready to accept data. If the SCL remains low beyond a certain time, the master should treat it as a bus error.
   - To clear a potentially hung bus, you can generate clock pulses by toggling the SCL line until the slave releases the bus. After the SCL line is released, you can send a STOP signal to reset the bus state.
   
4. **Bus Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor the SDA and SCL lines. If they're both high, the bus is free. If any line (especially SDA) remains low for an extended period, it may indicate a bus lock by a malfunctioning device.

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - If the bus is detected to be busy for an unusually long time or in an inconsistent state, apply recovery actions:
     1. Reset the I2C hardware module of the master.
     2. Generate STOP conditions to ensure the bus is free.
     3. If possible, reset or power-cycle the slave devices.
     4. Log or indicate the error for debugging or alert purposes.
   - After taking recovery actions, you can retry the communication. Implement a retry mechanism with a maximum retry count to prevent endless loops.

6. **Hardware Reset**:
   - In extreme cases, if the bus remains unresponsive or locked, consider having a mechanism to reset the entire system or the devices involved. This approach can be invasive and should be a last-resort option.

7. **Interrupt-based vs. Polling**:
   - If your microcontroller supports it, use interrupt-driven communication instead of polling. It can provide more immediate feedback on bus states and errors.

8. **External Supervisory Circuit**:
   - For critical applications, using an external supervisory circuit or watchdog that monitors the bus activity can be beneficial. If the bus is stuck or busy for too long, the circuit can reset the master or issue an alert.

Incorporate these strategies based on your system's needs, the criticality of I2C communication, available hardware features, and the specific use case.
