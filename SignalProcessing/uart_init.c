/*
Certainly! The specifics of `UART_Init` depend heavily on the microcontroller or platform being used. 
Different microcontrollers have different register names, configurations, and capabilities. 
For this example, I'll provide a general-purpose initialization routine using hypothetical register 
names and configurations, which you might see in a typical microcontroller.

Let's assume a 16 MHz microcontroller clock and a desired baud rate of 9600:
*/

#define F_CPU 16000000UL
#define BAUD 9600

// Hypothetical UART registers
#define UART_CONTROL_REG    *(volatile uint8_t *)(0x1000)
#define UART_BAUD_REG_LOW   *(volatile uint8_t *)(0x1001)
#define UART_BAUD_REG_HIGH  *(volatile uint8_t *)(0x1002)
#define UART_DATA_REG       *(volatile uint8_t *)(0x1003)
#define UART_STATUS_REG     *(volatile uint8_t *)(0x1004)

// Control register bits
#define UART_ENABLE         0x01
#define UART_TX_ENABLE      0x02
#define UART_RX_ENABLE      0x04
#define UART_PARITY_NONE    0x00
#define UART_STOP_BIT_ONE   0x10
#define UART_DATA_BITS_8    0x20

void UART_Init(uint32_t baudRate) {
    // Calculate the baud rate prescaler based on the formula (assuming no double speed)
    uint16_t baudPrescaler = ((F_CPU / (baudRate * 16UL))) - 1;

    // Set Baud Rate
    UART_BAUD_REG_HIGH = (baudPrescaler >> 8); // Shift the register right by 8 bits to get the high byte
    UART_BAUD_REG_LOW = baudPrescaler;

    // Configure Data Format: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
    UART_CONTROL_REG = UART_ENABLE | UART_TX_ENABLE | UART_RX_ENABLE | UART_PARITY_NONE | UART_STOP_BIT_ONE | UART_DATA_BITS_8;
}

Some points to note:

1. **Memory-mapped Registers**: The hypothetical UART registers are defined using memory-mapped I/O addresses (e.g., `0x1000`). These addresses and the corresponding register names will differ depending on the microcontroller.
  
2. **Baud Rate Prescaler Calculation**: This formula determines the value needed to achieve the desired baud rate. Again, this formula can differ based on the specific microcontroller. You'll often find the formula in the datasheet, under the UART or USART section.

3. **UART Control Register Configuration**: The `UART_CONTROL_REG` configuration assumes a simple control register where you can enable UART, set the number of data bits, stop bits, and parity all in one go. In reality, many microcontrollers have multiple control and configuration registers for UART, and you might need to set or clear specific bits in these registers to fully configure the UART module.

Always refer to the microcontroller's datasheet or reference manual to get the exact details for UART initialization.
