A number n is a power of 2 if n & (n - 1) == 0 and n is greater than zero. This is because, for numbers that are powers of 2, their binary representation has exactly one bit set, and subtracting 1 from them flips all bits after the set bit (including the set bit).

A number n is a power of 4 if the following conditions are met. 
a) There is only one bit set in the binary representation of n (or n is a power of 2) 
b) The count of zero bits before the (only) set bit is even.
For example 16 (10000) is the power of 4 because there is only one bit set and count of 0s before the set bit is 4 which is even.
